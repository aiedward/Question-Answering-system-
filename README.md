# Question-Answering-system-

# The search (user's question input) interface and its output...
for the first part of the project we have only predicted all the related tags that the user's question can be in.
We will use it in the classification of documents that will be required to retrieve proper answer to the user's query.
Note that the tags need not to be mutually exclusive i.e., a question can belong to multiple (overlapping) tags (topics).
